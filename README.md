# Weighted Sum Grade Calculator

This project implements a decision-making tool using the **weighted sum method** to compute final course grades for students, determine the score needed to get an A, identify the weakest assessment area, and find students with identical scores.

## Features

- ✅ Calculates final grades using weighted scores.
- ✅ Determines the minimum score needed on the final exam to earn an A.
- ✅ Identifies the assessment area where students lost the most points.
- ✅ Detects students with identical scores.
- ✅ Handles extra credit (scores over max count normally).
